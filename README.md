Hi ! I'm going to demonstrate my ` E-Shopping-App ` for Astraakathon Submission. This application lets you create an account, add or buy a product for sale. Follow the instructions given below for running this application in your Local System.

# Content

* [Run this application]()
* [Data Model for ` E-Shopping-App `]()
* [Reference]()

# Run this application

## 1.1 Prerequisite

you must have following installed in your local system.
1. Python 3.6 or later
2. Docker Desktop latest

## 1.2 Start Cassandra using Docker
To start cassandra on docker, jump into the specified directory and start ` CMD ` in the current directory.
```
cd E-shopping-app/materials
docker-compose up
```
Expected Output: (for single node cluster)
```
Creating network "materials_dc1ring" with driver "bridge"
Creating materials_cassandra-node1_1 ... done
Attaching to materials_cassandra-node1_1

cassandra-node1_1  | INFO  [main] 2020-08-19 09:17:39,474 CassandraDaemon.java:556 - Not starting RPC server as requested. Use JMX (StorageService->startRPCServer()) or nodetool (enablethrift) to start it
```

## 1.3 Create Schema Tables
Start the ` cassandra-node ` on docker dashboard and open `CLI ` for the node. Now run the following to open Cql shell for querrying.
```
# cqlsh
```
Expected Output:
```
Connected to spring_demo_cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.11.6 | CQL spec 3.4.4 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh>
```

Now copy the following querries to create a keyspace and some of its tables.
